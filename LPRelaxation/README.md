# Dataset

This repository implements a Branch-and-Price algorithm to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). The algorithm has been benchmarked using the Solomon dataset, a widely recognized set of instances in the field of vehicle routing problems.

## Solomon Dataset

The Solomon dataset, introduced by Marius Solomon in 1987, comprises 56 instances designed to evaluate the performance of VRPTW algorithms. Each instance includes 100 customers and is categorized based on customer distribution and scheduling horizon. The dataset is divided into six distinct types: C1, C2, R1, R2, RC1, and RC2.

### Instance Categories

1. **C-Type (Clustered Customers)**
   - **C1:** Features clustered customer locations with narrow time windows and small vehicle capacities, leading to solutions with more routes and fewer customers per route.
   - **C2:** Similar to C1 but with larger time windows and vehicle capacities, resulting in fewer routes with more customers per route.

2. **R-Type (Randomly Distributed Customers)**
   - **R1:** Contains randomly distributed customers with narrow time windows and small vehicle capacities, leading to solutions with more routes and fewer customers per route.
   - **R2:** Similar to R1 but with larger time windows and vehicle capacities, resulting in fewer routes with more customers per route.

3. **RC-Type (Mixed Distribution of Customers)**
   - **RC1:** Combines both clustered and randomly distributed customers with narrow time windows and small vehicle capacities, leading to solutions with more routes and fewer customers per route.
   - **RC2:** Similar to RC1 but with larger time windows and vehicle capacities, resulting in fewer routes with more customers per route.

Each instance file is named to reflect its category and specific characteristics. For example, `c101.txt` indicates a C1-type instance, while `r201.txt` corresponds to an R2-type instance.

## Benchmark Testing


Results on several datasets are documented in the `fig` directory and the B&P algorithm is proved efficient in solving the VRPTW (in some scenarios). **DO NOTICE** that though B&P is a efficient algorithm, its solving time for large scale dataset (with 100+ client nodes) will be huge.

**PLEASE DO NOTE** that The algorithm have not been tested across all instance types (`c101.txt` to `rc208.txt`). And It is confirmed that the algorithm solving SPPRC will end up into a dead cycle when solving dataset `c104.txt`. But unfortunately this repo will not be updated regarding this issue in the near future and we welcome commits dedicated to solving this bug.

For further details on the Solomon dataset and its applications, please refer to the original publication by Marius Solomon.
